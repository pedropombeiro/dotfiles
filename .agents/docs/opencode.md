# OpenCode Policies

## Storage Layout

When inspecting prior OpenCode sessions or tool results, verify the local storage
layout before assuming project-scoped paths from documentation.

- OpenCode data lives under `~/.local/share/opencode/`
- OpenCode docs may describe project-scoped storage under
  `~/.local/share/opencode/project/<project-slug>/storage/`
- Session diffs are stored in `~/.local/share/opencode/storage/session_diff/`
- Tool output is stored in `~/.local/share/opencode/tool-output/`
- Prefer targeted inspection of these known paths over broad recursive searches
  in large directory trees

## Command Chaining Approval

When a chained command is submitted using `&&`, `;`, `||`, or `|`:

- If all subcommands are explicitly allowed, run the chain as-is.
- If any subcommand is unknown or disallowed:
  - Split the chain into individual subcommands.
  - Ask the user to approve each subcommand before execution.
  - Execute only approved subcommands in original order.
  - Stop on first denial unless the user explicitly asks to continue.

### Approval Prompt

Your command contains multiple subcommands. I can run them one by one and ask
you to approve each. Proceed with:

1. <cmd1>
2. <cmd2>
3. <cmd3>
