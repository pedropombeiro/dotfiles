## Command Chaining Approval

When a chained command is submitted using `&&`, `;`, `||`, or `|`:

- If all subcommands are explicitly allowed, run the chain as-is.
- If any subcommand is unknown or disallowed:
  - Split the chain into individual subcommands.
  - Ask the user to approve each subcommand before execution.
  - Execute only approved subcommands in original order.
  - Stop on first denial unless the user explicitly asks to continue.

### Approval Prompt

Your command contains multiple subcommands. I can run them one by one and ask
you to approve each. Proceed with:

1. <cmd1>
2. <cmd2>
3. <cmd3>
