# Testing hk steps (`tests {}` + `hk test`)

Every hk step fails **open**: a glob that matches nothing exits 0, so a checker
that has quietly stopped detecting anything is indistinguishable from a clean
tree. A `tests {}` block on the step is what tells the two apart. `hk test` runs
them all; `Builtins.hk_test` wires that into the hook so they run whenever
`hk.pkl` is staged.

Available since hk 1.51.0.

## The fields

```pkl
["my-step"] {
    glob = List("**/*.sh")
    check = "bash .hk-hooks/my-check.sh {{files}}"

    tests {
        ["a bad file fails"] {
            run = "check"                       // "check" | "fix" | "command"
            write { ["{{tmp}}/bad.sh"] = "..." } // inline fixtures
            before = "chmod +x {{tmp}}/bad.sh"   // runs after write
            files = List("{{tmp}}/bad.sh")       // what renders {{files}}
            expect {
                code = 1
                stderr = "must be executable"    // substring match
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `run` | `check`, `fix`, or `command`. Defaults to `check` |
| `write` | Inline files to create in the sandbox, path to contents |
| `before` | Shell command run after `write`, before the step's own command |
| `after` | Shell command run after the step, before expectations are checked |
| `files` | Explicit list rendering `{{files}}`. Defaults to the `write` keys |
| `fixture` | A path copied into the sandbox instead of inline `write` |
| `env` | Extra environment variables for this test |
| `tmpdir` | Force sandbox on/off. Auto-detected from `{{tmp}}` when unset |
| `expect.code` | Expected exit code, default 0 |
| `expect.stdout` / `expect.stderr` | Substring that must appear |
| `expect.files` | Path to **full** expected contents, exact match |

## Fixture paths must be sandboxed

A bare relative fixture path with no `tmpdir = true` writes the fixture **into
the work tree and leaves it there**. Verified on 1.51.0 and again on 1.56.1: a
test writing `fixture-marker.txt` left that file in the repo after a green
`hk test`.

Where the work tree is `$HOME` - a dotfiles repo using the git-dir/work-tree
split - that is destructive rather than untidy. `write { [".npmrc"] = "..." }`
overwrites the real `.npmrc`.

Two spellings avoid it. Prefer the first:

```pkl
write { ["{{tmp}}/file.md"] = "..." }   // {{tmp}} auto-detects the sandbox
```

```pkl
tmpdir = true                            // explicit; then a bare name is safe
write { ["file.md"] = "..." }            // this is what the builtins do
```

Tests also run in parallel, so two of them sharing one bare path race for the
same file. A `{{tmp}}` path is per-test.

## Testing a whole-repo checker

A `{{tmp}}`-scoped fixture makes hk run the step **from the sandbox directory**,
which is the only reason a cwd-relative whole-repo checker is testable at all:
the checker reads the sandbox's files rather than the real ones.

That leaves the checker itself outside the sandbox. `{{root}}` is the repo root
and keeps pointing there inside a test, so `before` copies the single source in
rather than duplicating it into the fixture:

```pkl
["quarantine-drift"] {
    check = "python3 .hk-hooks/quarantine-drift.py"   // no {{files}}

    tests {
        ["one config out of step fails"] {
            run = "check"
            write { ["{{tmp}}/.npmrc"] = "min-release-age=9\n" }
            before = "mkdir -p .hk-hooks && cp {{root}}/.hk-hooks/quarantine-drift.py .hk-hooks/"
            expect {
                code = 1
                stderr = "min-release-age"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`{{root}}` expands in a step's own `check` too.

Prove the test discriminates: break the checker so it always passes, run
`hk test`, and confirm the matching cases go red. A test that never fails is
the same fail-open it was written to close.

## Globs and `{{files}}`

The step's `glob` does **not** decide whether a test runs - a step with a glob
matching nothing still runs its tests. But the glob **is** applied when
rendering `{{files}}`, so a fixture the glob excludes reaches the command as
nothing at all.

That combination bites when a step narrows an inherited glob. `Builtins.fix_smart_quotes`
ships tests writing `file.txt`; narrowing the step to `**/*.md` filtered that
fixture out, `{{files}}` rendered empty, and `hk util fix-smart-quotes` exited 2
on its own usage error - a failure about the harness, not the checker.

So a test pins a glob only by asserting a fixture reached the command.

## Wiring it into the hook

```pkl
["hk-test"] = (Builtins.hk_test) {}
```

Its glob is `hk.pkl` / `.config/hk.pkl`, so the suite runs whenever the config
is staged.

## Builtins bring their own tests

Adding that step activates **every** builtin's bundled tests, not just the ones
you wrote. Two classes fail on contact:

- **Tests invalidated by your own override.** Narrowing a `glob` or `types`
  breaks fixtures written for the unscoped builtin (the `fix_smart_quotes` case
  above). Replace them with equivalents scoped to your step - same coverage, now
  describing what you actually run.
- **Tests pinned to a tool version you do not have.** `Builtins.rumdl`'s
  `fix bad file violations remain` writes a fixture with no top-level heading
  and expects `fix` to exit 1 with MD041 unfixed; rumdl 0.2.52 does not flag
  MD041 there, fixes everything and exits 0. `Builtins.zizmor`'s fixtures all
  write `uses: actions/checkout@v4`, which zizmor 1.29's unpinned-uses policy
  flags, so even the "good" fixture exits 14. Neither says anything about your
  wiring. Drop them, with the reason at the step:

  ```pkl
  ["zizmor"] = (Builtins.zizmor) {
      // Upstream's fixtures use an unpinned action, which the pinned zizmor
      // flags; our own workflows are SHA-pinned and the step passes on them.
      tests = new {}
  }
  ```

  `tests {}` amends the inherited mapping and clears nothing. `tests = new {}`
  replaces it.

  It is all or nothing: a Test has no skip field, and a pkl Mapping entry cannot
  be removed by an amend, so one stale case costs every sibling case in that
  builtin. Say which case failed and why in the comment, so the next tool bump
  has something to retest against.

## Strip the git environment

A test's `before` runs bare `git` with whatever git environment the hook
inherited. `Builtins.actionlint`'s tests carry `before = "git init"`.

In a dotfiles repo whose wrapper exports `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE`, hk hands
that environment to every step - and `GIT_DIR` beats cwd discovery, so running
in a sandbox directory is no defence. At commit time that `git init`
re-initialised the real repo and tried to rewrite `core.filemode` in it; it
failed only because the commit in progress held the config lock.

```pkl
["hk-test"] = (Builtins.hk_test) {
    check = "env -u GIT_DIR -u GIT_WORK_TREE hk test --quiet"
}
```
