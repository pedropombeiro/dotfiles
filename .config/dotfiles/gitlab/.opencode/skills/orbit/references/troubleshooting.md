# Orbit skill troubleshooting

Common errors when using `glab orbit remote`, organised by exit code. See
[`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) for prerequisites.

## CLI exit codes

| Exit | HTTP | Meaning                                                      |
|------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0`  | 2xx  | Success.                                                     |
| `1`  | —    | Generic error (parse error, IO error, malformed body).       |
| `2`  | 404  | Orbit endpoint unavailable (typically: feature flag is off). |
| `3`  | 401  | Not authenticated.                                           |
| `4`  | 403  | Access denied (no Knowledge Graph enabled namespaces).       |
| `5`  | 429  | Rate limited.                                                |

`glab orbit remote query --format raw` is the easiest way to surface the full
JSON error payload when the exit code alone is not enough.

## Exit `2` — feature flag is off, or wrong subcommand

**Cause 1 — feature flag off.** Orbit is gated behind the `knowledge_graph`
feature flag. If it is disabled for your user, every endpoint returns 404.

**Fix:** contact an admin to enable `knowledge_graph` for your user.

**Cause 2 — wrong CLI path.** Make sure you are on `glab` v1.94.0+:

```bash
glab --version
glab orbit remote --help
```

If `glab orbit` is not recognised, upgrade `glab`.

## Exit `3` — not authenticated

**Cause:** Missing or expired `glab` auth.

**Fix:**

```bash
glab auth status
glab auth login    # if expired
```

## Exit `4` — `No Knowledge Graph enabled namespaces available`

**Cause:** Your user has the feature flag enabled but belongs to no top-level
group that has Orbit turned on.

**Fix:** an Owner of at least one top-level group you belong to must turn
Orbit on via **Orbit > Configuration** in the GitLab UI.

## Exit `5` — rate limited

**Cause:** Rate limit (`orbit_query`) exceeded.

**Fix:** back off and reduce churn. For agent-driven bulk work, lower `limit`,
add a short sleep between queries, or fold work into a single
aggregation/traversal query.

## Exit `1` — generic error

The most common causes:

- Malformed JSON request body (run `jq . /tmp/q.json` to validate).
- Unreachable hostname (check `glab auth status`).
- Network or TLS failure.

Re-run with `--format raw` and inspect stderr for details.

## Empty result body

**Cause:** Usually the query returned no rows. Confirm with a known-good probe:

```bash
cat > /tmp/q-min.json <<'JSON'
{"query": {"query_type": "traversal", "node": {"id": "p", "entity": "Project"}, "limit": 1}}
JSON
glab orbit remote query --format raw /tmp/q-min.json
```

If this returns a result, the connection works and your other query likely
has no matches.

## Validation errors (HTTP 400, exit `1`)

**Cause:** Query did not match the DSL JSON Schema. Common culprits:

- Using `node` (singular) with `aggregation` / `path_finding`
  (they require `nodes`, plural).
- Using `nodes` (plural) with `neighbors` or single-node `traversal`
  (they require `node`, singular).
- Multi-node `traversal` (uses `nodes`) without at least 2 nodes and 1 relationship.
- `query_type: "aggregation"` without any `aggregations` entries.
- `max_hops` or `max_depth` > 3 (server-enforced ceiling).
- `cursor.offset + cursor.page_size > limit`.

**Fix:** validate against the live DSL schema, which is authoritative and
always current:

```bash
glab orbit remote tools | jq '.[] | select(.name=="query_graph") | .description' -r
```

The `description` field embeds the full JSON Schema (inside a `<toon>` block
for compact transport — still parseable). Full field reference in
[`query_language.md`](query_language.md).

## Service unavailable

If `glab orbit remote status` shows any component unhealthy, retry with
exponential backoff. If persistent, escalate in the team Slack channel.
